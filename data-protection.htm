      <h2><b><a name="sec1"></a>Section 1: Policy
      Statement</b></h2>
      <p>Loughborough University is committed to a policy of protecting the rights and
privacy of individuals (includes students, staff and others) in accordance with
the Data Protection Act. The University needs to process certain information
about its staff, students and other individuals it has dealings with for
administrative purposes (eg to recruit and pay staff, to administer programmes
of study, to record progress, to agree awards, to collect fees, and to comply
with legal obligations to funding bodies and government). To comply with the
law, information about individuals must be collected and used fairly, stored
safely and securely and not disclosed to any third party unlawfully.</p>
<p>The policy applies to all staff and students of the University. Any breach of
the Data Protection Act 1998 or the University Data Protection Policy is
considered to be an offence and in that event, Loughborough University
disciplinary procedures will apply. As a matter of good practice, other agencies
and individuals working with the University, and who have access to personal
information, will be expected to have read and comply with this policy. It is
expected that departments/sections who deal with external agencies will take
responsibility for ensuring that such agencies sign a contract agreeing to abide
by this policy.</p>
<h2><br />
  <a name="sec2"></a>Section <b>2</b>: Background to the Data Protection Act 1998</h2>

<p>The Data Protection Act 1998 enhances and broadens the scope of the Data
Protection Act 1984. Its purpose is to protect the rights and privacy of living
individuals and to ensure that personal data is not processed without their
knowledge, and, wherever possible, is processed with their consent.</p>

  Responsibilities under the Data Protection Act</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The University as a body corporate is the data controller under the new
    Act.</li>
  <li>A Data Protection Officer has been appointed who is responsible for
    day-to-day data protection matters and for developing specific guidance
    notes on data protection issues for members of the University.</li>
  <li>A Data Protection Advisory Group (DPAG) has been established to advise on
    data protection issues and provide support for the Data Protection Officer.
    DPAG is chaired by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor and reports to Information
    Services Committee. The Data Protection Officer is Secretary to DPAG.</li>
  <li>The Senior Management Group (VC, DVC, PVCs and Deans), Heads of
    Departments/Sections, Directors of Research Institutes/Centres and all those
    in managerial or supervisory roles are responsible for developing and
    encouraging good information handling practice within the University.</li>
  <li>Compliance with data protection legislation is the responsibility of all
    members of the University who process personal information.</li>
  <li>Members of the University are responsible for ensuring that any personal
    data supplied to the University are accurate and up-to-date.</li>
  </ul>
<h2><br />
  <a name="sec5"></a>Section 5:
  Notification</h2>
<p>Notification is the responsibility of the Registrar and the Data Protection
Officer. Details of the University's notification are published on the <a href="http://www.dataprotection.gov.uk/">Information
Commissioner's website</a>. Anyone who is, or intends, processing
data for purposes not included in the University's Notification should seek
advice from the Data Protection Officer.</p>
<h2><br />
    <a name="sec6"></a>Section 6: Data
    Protection Principles</h2>
<p>All processing of personal data must be done in accordance with the eight
data protection principles.</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Personal data shall be processed fairly and
      lawfully.</b><br />
Those responsible for processing personal data must make reasonable
      efforts to ensure that data subjects are informed of the identity of the
      data controller, the purpose(s) of the processing, any disclosures to
      third parties that are envisaged and an indication of the period for which
      the data will be kept.</li>
  <li><b>Personal data shall be obtained for specific
      and lawful purposes and not processed in a manner incompatible with those
      purposes.</b><i><br />
      </i>Data obtained for specified purposes must not be used for a purpose
      that differs from those.</li>
  <li><b>Personal data shall be adequate, relevant
      and not excessive in relation to the purpose for which it is held.</b><i><br />
      </i>Information, which is not strictly necessary for the purpose for which
      it is obtained, should not be collected. If data are given or obtained
      which is excessive for the purpose, they should be immediately deleted or
      destroyed.</li>
  <li><b>Personal data shall be accurate and, where
      necessary, kept up to date.</b><i><br />
      </i>Data, which are kept for a long time, must be reviewed and updated as
      necessary. No data should be kept unless it is reasonable to assume that
      they are accurate. It is the responsibility of individuals to ensure that
      data held by the University are accurate and up-to-date. Completion of an
      appropriate registration or application form etc will be taken as an
      indication that the data contained therein is accurate. Individuals should
      notify the University of any changes in circumstance to enable personal
      records to be updated accordingly. It is the responsibility of the
      University to ensure that any notification regarding change of
      circumstances is noted and acted upon.</li>
  <li><b>Personal data shall be kept only for as long
      as necessary.</b> (see Section 12 on <a href="#sec12">Retention
      and Disposal of Data</a>)</li>
  <li><b>Personal data shall be processed in
      accordance with the rights of data subjects under the Data Protection Act.</b><i> </i>(see Section 7 on <a href="#sec7">Data Subjects
      Rights</a>)</li>
  <li><b>Appropriate technical and organisational
      measures shall be taken against unauthorised or unlawful processing of
      personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of data.</b><i> </i>(see
      Section 9 on <a href="#sec9">Security of Data</a>)</li>
  <li><b>Personal data shall not be transferred to a
      country or a territory outside the European Economic Area unless that
      country or territory ensures an adequate level of protection for the
      rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of
      personal data.</b><i><br />
      </i>Data must not be transferred outside of the European Economic Area (EEA)
      - the fifteen EU Member States together with Iceland, Liechtenstein and
      Norway - without the explicit consent of the individual. Members of the
      University should be particularly aware of this when publishing
      information on the Internet, which can be accessed from anywhere in the
      globe. This is because transfer includes placing data on a web site that
      can be accessed from outside the EEA.</li>
  </ol>
<h2><br />
    <a name="sec7"></a>Section 7: Data
    Subject Rights</h2>
<p>Data Subjects have the following rights regarding data processing, and the
data that are recorded about them:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To make subject access requests regarding the nature of information held
    and to whom it has been disclosed.</li>
  <li>To prevent processing likely to cause damage or distress.</li>
  <li>To prevent processing for purposes of direct marketing.</li>
  <li>To be informed about mechanics of automated decision taking process that
    will significantly affect them.</li>
  <li>Not to have significant decisions that will affect them taken solely by
    automated process.</li>
  <li>To sue for compensation if they suffer damage by any contravention of the
    Act.</li>
  <li>To take action to rectify, block, erase or destroy inaccurate data.</li>
  <li>To request the Commissioner to assess whether any provision of the Act has
    been contravened.</li>
  </ul>
<h2><br />
    <a name="sec8"></a>Section 8:
    Consent</h2>
<p>Wherever possible, personal data or sensitive data should not be obtained,
held, used or disclosed unless the individual has given consent. The University
understands &quot;consent&quot; to mean that the data subject has been fully
informed of the intended processing and has signified their agreement, whilst
being in a fit state of mind to do so and without pressure being exerted upon
them. Consent obtained under duress or on the basis of misleading information
will not be a valid basis for processing. There must be some active
communication between the parties such as signing a form and the individual must
sign the form freely of their own accord. Consent cannot be inferred from
non-response to a communication. For sensitive data, explicit written consent of
data subjects must be obtained unless an alternative legitimate basis for
processing exists.</p>
<p>In most instances consent to process personal and sensitive data is obtained
routinely by the University (eg when a student signs a registration form or when
a new member of staff signs a contract of employment). Any University forms
(whether paper-based or web-based) that gather data on an individual should
contain a statement explaining what the information is to be used for and to
whom it may be disclosed. It is particularly important to obtain specific
consent if an individual's data are to be published on the Internet as such data
can be accessed from all over the globe. Therefore, not gaining consent could
contravene the eighth data protection principle.</p>
<p>If an individual does not consent to certain types of processing (eg direct
marketing), appropriate action must be taken to ensure that the processing does
not take place.</p>
<p>If any member of the University is in any doubt about these matters, they
should consult the University Data Protection Officer.</p>
<h2><br />
    <a name="sec9"></a>Section 9:&nbsp;Security
  of Data</h2>
<p>All staff are responsible for ensuring that any personal data (on others)
which they hold are kept securely and that they are not disclosed to any
unauthorised third party (see Section 11 on <a href="#sec11">Disclosure
of Data</a> for more detail).</p>
<p>All personal data should be accessible only to those who need to use it. You
should form a judgement based upon the sensitivity and value of the information
in question, but always consider keeping personal data:</p>
<ul>
  <li>in a lockable room with controlled access, or</li>
  <li>in a locked drawer or filing cabinet, or</li>
  <li>if computerised, password protected, or</li>
  <li>kept on disks which are themselves kept securely.</li>
</ul>
<p>Care should be taken to ensure that PCs and terminals are not visible except
to authorised staff and that computer passwords are kept confidential. PC
screens should not be left unattended without password protected screen-savers
and manual records should not be left where they can be accessed by unauthorised
personnel.</p>
<p>Care must be taken to ensure that appropriate security measures are in place
for the deletion or disposal of personal data. Manual records should be shredded
or disposed of as &quot;confidential waste&quot;. Hard drives of redundant PCs
should be wiped clean before disposal.</p>
<p>This policy also applies to staff and students who process personal data
&quot;off-site&quot;. Off-site processing presents a potentially greater risk of
loss, theft or damage to personal data. Staff and students should take
particular care when processing personal data at home or in other locations
outside the University campus.</p>
<h2><br />
  <a name="sec10"></a>Section 10:&nbsp;Rights
  of Access to Data</h2>
<p>Members of the University have the right to access any personal data which
are held by the University in electronic format and manual records which form
part of a relevant filing system. This includes the right to inspect
confidential personal references received by the University about that person.</p>
<p>Any individual who wishes to exercise this right should apply in
writing to the Data Protection Officer. The University reserves the right to
charge a fee for data subject access requests (currently £10). Any such request
will normally be complied with within 40 days of receipt of the written request
and, where appropriate, the fee. See <a href="../procsar/index.htm">Subject
Access Request Procedure</a> (available from the University Data
Protection webpages) for more detail.&nbsp; For information on responding to
subject access requests see <a href="../sareq/index.htm">Appendix 1</a>
of this policy.</p>
<p>In order to respond efficiently to subject access requests the University
needs to have in place appropriate records management practices.&nbsp; See
Appendices II, III and
IV for further
information on records management.</p>
<h2><br />
    <a name="sec11"></a>Section 11:&nbsp;Disclosure
  of Data</h2>
<p>The University must ensure that personal data are not disclosed to
unauthorised third parties which includes family members, friends, government
bodies, and in certain circumstances, the Police. All staff and students should
exercise caution when asked to disclose personal data held on another individual
to a third party. For instance, it would usually be deemed appropriate to
disclose a colleague's work contact details in response to an enquiry regarding
a particular function for which they are responsible. However, it would not
usually be appropriate to disclose a colleague's work details to someone who
wished to contact them regarding a non-work related matter. The important thing
to bear in mind is whether or not disclosure of the information is relevant to,
and necessary for, the conduct of University business. Best practice, however,
would be to take the contact details of the person making the enquiry and pass
them onto the member of the University concerned.</p>
<p>This policy determines that personal data may be legitimately disclosed where
one of the following conditions apply:</p>
<ol>
  <li>the individual has given their consent (eg a
      student/member of staff has consented to the University corresponding with
      a named third party);</li>
  <li>where the disclosure is in the legitimate
      interests of the institution (eg disclosure to staff - personal
      information can be disclosed to other University employees if it is clear
      that those members of staff require the information to enable them to
      perform their jobs);</li>
  <li>where the institution is legally obliged to
      disclose the data (eg HESA and HESES returns, ethnic minority and
      disability monitoring);</li>
  <li>where disclosure of data is required for the
      performance of a contract (eg informing a student's LEA or sponsor of
      course changes/withdrawal etc).</li>
  </ol>
<p>The Act permits certain disclosures without consent so long as the
information is requested for one or more of the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>to safeguard national security*;</li>
  <li>prevention or detection of crime including the apprehension or prosecution
    of offenders*;</li>
  <li>assessment or collection of tax duty*;</li>
  <li>discharge of regulatory functions (includes health, safety and welfare of
    persons at work)*;</li>
  <li>to prevent serious harm to a third party;</li>
  <li>to protect the vital interests of the individual, this refers to life and
    death situations.</li>
</ul>
<p>* Requests must be supported by appropriate paperwork.</p>
<p>When members of staff receive enquiries as to whether a named individual is a
member of the University, the enquirer should be asked why the information is
required. If consent for disclosure has not been given and the reason is not one
detailed above (ie consent not required), the member of staff should decline to
comment. Even confirming whether or not an individual is a member of the
University may constitute an unauthorised disclosure.</p>
<p>Unless consent has been obtained from the data subject, information should
not be disclosed over the telephone. Instead, the enquirer should be asked to
provide documentary evidence to support their request. Ideally a statement from
the data subject consenting to disclosure to the third party should accompany
the request.</p>
<p>As an alternative to disclosing personal data, the University may offer to do
one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>pass a message to the data subject asking them to contact the enquirer;</li>
  <li>accept a sealed envelope/incoming email message and attempt to forward it
    to the data subject.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please remember to inform the enquirer that such action will be taken
conditionally: ie &quot;if the person is a member of the University&quot; to
avoid confirming their membership of, their presence in or their absence from
the institution.</p>
<p>Further information regarding the disclosure of personal information can be
found in Appendices V (<a href="../disclosure/index.htm">student information</a>) and VI
(<a href="../telephone/index.htm">telephone protocol</a>).</p>
<p>If in doubt, staff should seek advice from their Head of Department/Section
or the University Data Protection Officer.</p>
<h2><br />
    <a name="sec12"></a>Section 12:&nbsp;Retention
    and Disposal of Data</h2>
<p>The University discourages the retention of personal data for longer than
they are required. Considerable amounts of data are collected on current staff
and students. However, once a member of staff or student has left the
institution, it will not be necessary to retain all the information held on
them. Some data will be kept for longer periods than others.</p>
<h3>Students</h3>
<p>In general, electronic student records containing information about
  individual students are kept indefinitely and information would typically
  include name and address on entry and completion, programmes taken, examination
  results, awards obtained.</p>
<p>Departments should regularly review the personal files of individual students
in accordance with the University's Records Retention Schedule (<a href="../recret/index.htm">Appendix
VII</a>).</p>
<h3>Staff</h3>
<p>In general, electronic staff records containing information about individual
  members of staff are kept indefinitely and information would typically include
  name and address, positions held, leaving salary. Other information relating to
  individual members of staff will be kept by the Personnel Department for 6 years
  from the end of employment. Information relating to Income Tax, Statutory
  Maternity Pay etc will be retained for the statutory time period (between 3 and
  6 years).</p>
<p>Departments should regularly review the personal files of individual staff
members in accordance with the University's Records Retention Schedule (<a href="../recret/index.htm">Appendix
VII</a>).</p>
<p>Information relating to unsuccessful applicants in connection with
recruitment to a post must be kept for 12 months from the interview date.
Personnel may keep a record of names of individuals that have applied for, be
short-listed, or interviewed, for posts indefinitely. This is to aid management
of the recruitment process.</p>
<h3>Disposal of Records</h3>
<p>Personal data must be disposed of in a way that protects the rights and
  privacy of data subjects (eg, shredding, disposal as confidential waste, secure
  electronic deletion).</p>
<h2><br />
    <a name="sec13"></a>Section 13:&nbsp;Publication
    of University Information</h2>
<p>All members of the University should note that the University publishes a
number of items that include personal data, and will continue to do so. These
personal data are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="word-spacing: 0; line-height: 100%; margin-right: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Information
        published in the University Calendar including:</span>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="margin-top: 0">names of all members of University Committees
      (including Court, Council and Senate).</span></li>
      <li>Names, job titles and academic
      and/or professional qualifications of members of staff.</li>
      <li>Awards and Honours (including
      Honorary Graduands, Emeritus Professors, Sir Robert Martin Prizewinners).</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Internal Telephone Directory.</li>
  <li>Student pass lists including grades.</li>
  <li>Graduation programmes and videos or other multimedia versions of
    graduation ceremonies.</li>
  <li>Information in prospectuses (including photographs), annual reports,
    staff newsletters, etc.</li>
  <li>Staff information on the University website (including photographs). </li>
  </ul>
<p>It is recognised that there might be occasions when a member of staff, a
student, or a lay member of the University, requests that their personal details
in some of these categories remain confidential or are restricted to internal
access. All individuals should be offered an opportunity to opt-out of the
publication of the above (and other) data. In such instances, the University
should comply with the request and ensure that appropriate action is taken.</p>
<h2><br />
    <a name="sec14"></a>Section 14:&nbsp;Direct
  Marketing</h2>
<p>Any department or section that uses personal data for direct marketing
purposes must inform data subjects of this at the time of collection of the
data. Individuals must be provided with the opportunity to object to the use of
their data for direct marketing purposes (eg an opt-out box on a form).</p>
<h2><br />
    <a name="sec15"></a>Section 15:&nbsp;Use
  of CCTV</h2>
<p>The University's use of CCTV is regulated by a separate Code of Practice.</p>
<p>For reasons of personal security and to protect University premises and the
property of staff and students, close circuit television cameras are in
operation in certain campus locations. The presence of these cameras may not be
obvious. This policy determines that personal data obtained during monitoring
will be processed as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>any monitoring will be carried out only by a limited number of specified
    staff;</li>
  <li>the recordings will be accessed only by the Security Manager, the Deputy
    Security Manager, Security Supervisors and Security Control Room Operators;</li>
  <li>personal data obtained during monitoring will be destroyed as soon as
    possible after any investigation is complete;</li>
  <li>staff involved in monitoring will maintain confidentiality in respect of
    personal data.</li>
  </ul>
<h2><br />
    <a name="sec16"></a>Section 16:&nbsp;Academic
  Research</h2>
<p>Personal data collected only for the purposes of academic research (includes
work of staff and students) must be processed in compliance with the Data
Protection Act 1998.</p>
<p>Researchers should note that personal data processed ONLY for research
purposes receive certain exemptions (detailed below) from the Data Protection
Act 1998 IF:</p>
<ol>
  <li>the data are not processed to support measures or decisions with respect
    to particular individuals AND</li>
  <li>if any data subjects are not caused substantial harm or distress by the
    processing of the data</li>
</ol>
<p>If the above conditions are met, the following exemptions may be applied to
data processed for research purposes only:</p>
<ul>
  <li>personal data can be processed for purposes other than that for which they
    were originally obtained (exemption from Principle 2);</li>
  <li>personal data can be held indefinitely (exemption from Principle 5);</li>
  <li>personal data are exempt from data subject access rights where the data
    are processed for research purposes and the results are anonymised
    (exemption from part of Principle 6 relating to access to personal data).</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than these three exceptions, the Data Protection Act applies in full.
The obligations to obtain consent before using data, to collect only necessary
and accurate data, and to hold data securely and confidentially must all still
be complied with.</p>
<h3>Notes to Researchers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>a) Whilst the Act states that research may
      legitimately involve processing of personal data beyond the originally
      stated purposes (eg longitudinal studies), the University hopes that,
      wherever possible, researchers will contact participants if it is intended
      to use data for purposes other than that for which they were originally
      collected.</li>
  <li>b) Although the Act allows personal data processed
      only for research purposes to be kept indefinitely, researchers are asked
      to refer to the Ethical Advisory Committee's guidelines on <a href="http://www.lboro.ac.uk/admin/committees/ethical/gn/dcas.htm">Data
      Collection and Storage</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For those departments which gather sensitive personal data (as defined by the
Act, see Section 3 on <a href="#sec3">Definitions</a>),
extra care should be taken to ensure that explicit consent is gained and that
data are held securely and confidentially so as to avoid unlawful disclosure.</p>
<h3>Publication</h3>
<p>Researchers should ensure that the results of the research are anonymised
  when published and that no information is published that would allow individuals
  to be identified. Results of the research can be published on the web or
  otherwise sent outside the European Economic Area but if this includes any
  personal data, the specific consent of the data subject must, wherever possible,
  be obtained.</p>
